Solution

1. PostgreSQL Schema for Devices

A minimal devices table with appropriate constraints:

CREATE TABLE devices (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
ip_address INET NOT NULL UNIQUE,
status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'offline',
last_seen_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_devices_status ON devices(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_devices_last_seen ON devices(last_seen_at);

Notes:

ip_address uses PostgreSQL’s INET type for IPv4/IPv6 validation and indexing.

Unique constraint ensures no duplicate IP addresses.

last_seen_at stored as timestamp with timezone for accurate logging.

Indexes improve search/filter performance (status, last_seen_at).

2. Front-End Integration with RESTful Backend

The Vue.js/TypeScript front-end calls a REST API (Node.js/Express or similar).

Typical endpoints:

GET /devices → List all devices

POST /devices → Add a new device

PUT /devices/:id → Update a device

DELETE /devices/:id → Remove a device

Evolution possibilities:

Support pagination, filtering, and sorting via query parameters.

Add GraphQL endpoint for more flexible queries.

3. Security Considerations

Validation:

Client-side validation improves UX but is not secure.

Server-side validation is authoritative (e.g., IP format, uniqueness).

Rate limiting:

Protect APIs from abuse, e.g., POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints.

Error handling:

Return standardized JSON error objects ({status, message, details}).

Use HTTP status codes properly (400, 404, 500).

Trade-offs:

Client-side validation reduces server load and gives immediate feedback.

Server-side is required to enforce data integrity and security.

4. DNS vs. IP Addressing

IP Address: Numeric address for routing (IPv4, IPv6).

DNS (Domain Name System): Human-readable names (FQDN: device.example.com) mapped to IPs via A (IPv4) or AAAA (IPv6) records.

Considerations in a real system:

Devices may be reachable by IP or hostname.

Front-end displays both for clarity.

DNS resolution is performed by the browser/OS, not by the app.

Browser cannot do raw DNS lookups due to security (sandboxing) and network restrictions.

Server-side services handle DNS-to-IP resolution and caching when needed.

This approach provides a solid database foundation, clear API contract, and practical front-end/backend integration, while accounting for security and operational concerns.
